## Falling Down The Pit

> — Mary Shelley, _Frankenstein_

After working on and off for about a year _(Feels like 3)_, I'm finally somewhat happy with this all-new redesign of chadkatz.com. This journey took way, way too long and reflects most of my learning in all things web development since starting from the ground up and teaching myself HTML.

### 1. Literal Pitfalls

Randomly, one day around a year ago from this posting, I decided that I would make use of the domain my family had owned for so long and built a website — and thus kicked off the most horrendous programming crusade that I couldn't even fathom.

This website is built on a less-than-optimal file structure on a React framework I had no idea how to use at the time, and which isn't optimal for this type of static site **(I should have used Astro instead)**, but I foolishly didn't stop and decided that I would learn as I go — a mistake that I am sure to repeat until I either quit programming altogether or become one with the computer. didnt stop and decided that I would learn as I go a mistake that I am sure to repeat until I either quit programming altogether or become one with the computer

### 2. Design and Redesign and Redesign

The coolest part for me about having my own site was the idea of a _personal brand_ that I could stamp on everything, and I tried.

I watched Figma Tutorials, skimmed UX and UI courses and the best I could come up with at first was this:

_incredible right?_

but this would be a good showing compared to some of my more experimental designs:

![](/alive-post/failedDesigns1.png)
![](/alive-post/failedDesigns4.png)

_what was I thinking?_

There’s like 20 different designs I'm leaving out to keep this from being a photo album of stupid ideas failed designs, but I never stopped trying.

### 3. Cant Design? Then Steal

Even with the current design of my site being something that I'm proud, of I took **HEAVY** inspiration from others. basically just copying what they did. I will say that I did and always have coded all of my projects myself and never passed someone’s code or design off as my own so quickly here are the current sites I was _inspired_ by that I’ll touch on later

But I had a array of insperation sites that I tried to mimic at the time one of which will be more important later on but here’s a few of my favorites

### 1. Make It Yourself

![](/alive-post/cube1.png)

This is the only photo I have of my first ever running site tthat I was, _at the time_, proud of. The reason that I'm not anymore is looking back on it, _99%_ of that was made by ChatGPT. I'm glad that almost no one ever saw it because im ashamed to have tried to pass something that I didn't make off as my own

Not to say i didnt use chat gpt and ai help for this website **(I Used it more then id like to admit)** but I'm confident that if needed I could redo this entire thing without it.
I learned nothing from making this and I can’t remake this without AI tools if I tried so it was just a waste of time.

### 2. Make Someone Else Make It

That’s my friend Morgan, a super talented designer who was unfathomably helpful throughout this whole year-long journey. Without his subtle influence, who knows how this project would have turned out — or if it would have finished at all.
Same goes for the support of my friends and family, who never hesitated to tell me everything that was wrong with it.

Morgan was also the designer of the frog Logo used as this sites icon and is super talented. More of his stuff can be found here:

### 3. Color Hunting

By far one of the hardest non technical parts of this project was finding colors that look good together, I couldnt even settle on one so i picked 5 diffrent ones I liked and i still cant tell if it looks good or not. here some ideas that didnt qutie make it

all but the last one are a pain to even look at

## Even More Remakes

### 1. No One Knows

I wish I had a photo of my old site but sadly I dont, this was my first site that went live and it was basicly a horrible clone of [Brittany Chiang's](https://brittanychiang.com) website, the only proof of it I have is from this reddit tread I posted on when it was Live

![](/alive-post/failedsite2.png)

I took it down right before I started making this site without knowing I would need a photo of it

### 2. Green Light

![](/alive-post/failedsite1.png)

I took a few months off from this project after those failed redesigns, and when I came back, this was the first design I made that I actually kind of liked. The super bold green, the massive in-your-face text, the small but clear header — I liked it then, and I still like it now.

But no one else did. And after thinking about it more, they were right. What would employers think when they saw this? Was my entire brand just bold and minimal, with no substance? I needed to pivot — to really think about what I wanted people to feel when they saw this site, as if it were an extension of me.

### 2. React

`npx create-next-app@latest`

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

At this point, I was completely lost and had no idea what I was doing. I kept exploring new ideas and slowly started narrowing in on what I actually wanted to create — what I liked, what I didn’t. Eventually, it came down to a few key design trends I knew I wanted to focus on

### 1. No Scroll Bar When Possible

### 2. No Loading

### 3. Less Is More

This might Be because I cant design already so more then two colors hurts my head but one of the common themes I noticed about my sites that I hated was all of the visual noise. take this for example:

![](/alive-post/failedsite3.png)

Another failed Site of mine that used no scroll bar, had no loading or unessary bloat but I still hated it and I couldnt undestand why. I still cant undestand fully but I'm pretty confident that it had something to do with the gradient.

Its odd because I love that gradient color and i think it goes well with the white but for some reason it just dosnt fit together and i think thats what alot of my websites had. Indivitual good ideas that worked poorly together
