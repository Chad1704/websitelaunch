## Falling Down The Pit

After working on and off for about a year _(Feels like 3)_, I'm finally somewhat happy with this all-new redesign of chadkatz.com. This journey took way, way too long and reflects most of my learning in all things web development since starting from the ground up and teaching myself HTML.

### 1. Literal Pitfalls

Randomly, one day around a year ago from this posting, I decided that I would make use of the domain my family had owned for so long and built a website — and thus kicked off the most horrendous programming crusade that I couldn't even fathom.

This website is built on a less-than-optimal file structure on a React framework I had no idea how to use at the time, and which isn't optimal for this type of static site **(I should have used Astro instead)**, but I foolishly didn't stop and decided that I would learn as I go — a mistake that I am sure to repeat until I either quit programming altogether or become one with the computer. didnt stop and decided that I would learn as I go a mistake that I am sure to repeat until I either quit programming altogether or become one with the computer

### 2. Design and Redesign and Redesign

The coolest part for me about having my own site was the idea of a _personal brand_ that I could stamp on everything, and I tried.

I watched Figma Tutorials, skimmed UX and UI courses and the best I could come up with at first was this:

_incredible right?_

but this would be a good showing compared to some of my more experimental designs:

_what was I thinking?_

There’s like 20 different designs I'm leaving out to keep this from being a photo album of stupid ideas failed designs, but I never stopped trying.

### 3. Cant Design? Then Steal

Even with the current design of my site being something that I'm proud, of I took **HEAVY** inspiration from others. basically just copying what they did. I will say that I did and always have coded all of my projects myself and never passed someone’s code or design off as my own so quickly here are the current sites I was _inspired_ by that I’ll touch on later

But I had a array of insperation sites that I tried to mimic at the time one of which will be more important later on but here’s a few of my favorites

### 1. Make It Yourself

This is the only photo I have of my first ever running site tthat I was, _at the time_, proud of. The reason that I'm not anymore is looking back on it, _99%_ of that was made by ChatGPT. I'm glad that almost no one ever saw it because im ashamed to have tried to pass something that I didn't make off as my own

Not to say i didnt use chat gpt and ai help for this website **(I Used it more then id like to admit)** but I'm confident that if needed I could redo this entire thing without it.
I learned nothing from making this and I can’t remake this without AI tools if I tried so it was just a waste of time.

### 2. Make Someone Else Make It

That’s my friend Morgan who is a super talented designer who was unfathomably helpful in this whole year long journey. without his subtle influence who knows how this project would have turned out, or if it would even finish at all
