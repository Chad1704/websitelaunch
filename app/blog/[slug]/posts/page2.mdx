# Building My First Personal Website with HTML & CSS

_May 21, 2025 â€¢ 4 min read_

Ever thought about building your own website but didn't know where to start? I just made my first personal site, and I want to walk you through how I did it using just basic HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ›  What I Used

I kept things super simple. Hereâ€™s what I used:

- A text editor (I used VS Code)
- A web browser (Chrome, but any works)
- Basic knowledge of HTML & CSS

No frameworks, no JavaScript, no hosting (yet!) â€” just the fundamentals.

## ðŸ§± Step 1: Setting Up the HTML

I created a new file called `index.html`. Here's the structure I started with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Personal Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
      <p>Just a chill place on the internet.</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm learning to code and this is my first website. ðŸŽ‰</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To-Do App</li>
          <li>Weather Dashboard</li>
          <li>Coming soon...</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2025 Me. Built with love and caffeine.</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
